# Authentication (checks identity) & Authorization (checks access)
how may whys for authenticate users ?
  Password	Most common
  Multi-Factor Authentication 	Secure login, banking, enterprise apps
  OAuth/Social Login	Fast login, user convenience
  Token-Based (JWT)	APIs, SPAs, mobile apps
  Session-Based	Traditional web apps
  Magic Link	Passwordless login

Devise gem: setup, customizations, OmniAuth integration

JWT-based auth for APIs

Role-based access control (e.g., Pundit, CanCanCan)

Authentication techniques:

Cookie-based sessions

Token-based (e.g., for APIs)

OAuth2 / SSO integration

# ActiveRecord & Database
Associations (has_many, belongs_to, etc.)

Eager loading vs lazy loading (includes, joins, etc.)

Scopes and custom queries

Transactions and locking

Indexes and performance tuning

Raw SQL in ActiveRecord

# API Development

# Background Jobs & Scheduling
Sidekiq, DelayedJob, Resque

Active Job abstraction

Caching: fragment, Russian doll caching, low-level

Query optimization, DB indexing

Rack middleware

Page rendering speed improvements

# Deployment & DevOps
Capistrano

Dockerize a Rails app

Heroku, AWS (EC2, S3, RDS)

Environment configs

Logs and monitoring (Lograge, Sentry)

# Front-End Integration
Hotwire/Turbo and Stimulus (Rails 7+)

Webpacker / importmaps / asset pipeline
