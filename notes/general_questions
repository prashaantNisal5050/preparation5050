Object-Oriented Principles (SOLID)
S – Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) – Each class should have only one reason to change.
O – Open/Closed Principle (OCP) – Code should be open for extension but closed for modification.
L – Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP) – Subclasses should be substitutable for their base classes.
I – Interface Segregation Principle (ISP) – Avoid forcing classes to implement unnecessary methods.
D – Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP) – Depend on abstractions, not concrete implementations.
