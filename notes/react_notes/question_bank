- what is react element? component?
- jsx? we can write html code in javascript 
- react fragment? any function is returing only one value 
- how will you return two div element without react fragment?
  if you don’t want to add extra DOM nodes (like a parent <div>), you can return an array of elements — each with a key:
function MyComponent() {
  return [
    <div key="1">First Div</div>,
    <div key="2">Second Div</div>
  ];
}
