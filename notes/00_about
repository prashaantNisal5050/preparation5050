"I’m a software engineer with over 4 years of hands-on experience working with Ruby on Rails. I’ve developed and maintained full-stack web applications, primarily in the e-commerce and data-heavy domains, and I’m currently focused on building scalable backend systems. I enjoy writing clean, testable code and have a strong grasp of Rails internals, RESTful API development, and working with both SQL and NoSQL databases like PostgreSQL and MongoDB."

"In my current role at Dassault Systems, I’m involved in migrating systems from MySQL to an in-house distributed database, and I'm building a Ruby adapter gem to support that migration. Beyond Rails, I have solid frontend experience with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and I’ve recently started working with React to deepen my full-stack capabilities. I’m a collaborative team player with a proactive attitude and strong debugging skills. I'm excited about the opportunity at Parity Cube because I enjoy working on high-traffic systems that impact real users at scale."----

about yourself.



I’m Prashant Nisal, born and raised in Pune, 
where I completed my MCA from Pune University in 2014. 

I have 10 years of experience in IT, with the last 6 years focused on Ruby on Rails development.

Current Role & Project:
Currently, I’m working as a Software Engineer at Dassault Systems,

I am part of the database driver development team, where we are working on migrating applications from MySQL to our in-house NuoDB solution to optimize costs and performance. As part of this initiative, I am developing a Ruby gem that acts as a database adapter, enabling  connectivity between Ruby on Rails applications and NuoDB—similar to how the mysql2 or pg gems function.

Past Experience:
Before this, I worked as a web developer in the medical & health relathed  projects.

My technical expertise includes:
Ruby on Rails for web application development
Databases like MySQL, PostgreSQL, and NuoDB
API development and testing
Frontend technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery
Apart from work, I enjoy exploring new technologies, and recently, I’ve been learning ReactJS to expand my full-stack development capabilities.

Looking forward to connecting and sharing knowledge. Thank you!

About Current role/projects:

We have our own database, NuoDB, and several Ruby on Rails applications in the medical domain.
The company decided to migrate from MySQL to NuoDB to reduce costs.
However, there was no existing solution to enable integration between Ruby on Rails applications and NuoDB. 
To address this gap, I took initiative to create a custom Ruby gem, a database driver, allowing Ruby on Rails applications to connect to and interact with NuoDB efficiently."

let me summarise this discussion in short:
I have been developing a gem called "Ruby on Rails Adapter for NuoDB Databases" which is simmiler to mysql2 or pg gems.
This project showcased my expertise in Ruby, Ruby on Rails, ActiveRecord, and database integrations and ability to take ownership. (optional)

challenges in current project:
  1.Handling NuoDB-Specific SQL Features
  NuoDB has different SQL syntax and behavior compared to MySQL/PostgreSQL, especially in areas like indexing, transaction handling, and autoincrement behavior. Some ActiveRecord queries that work with MySQL do not execute correctly on NuoDB.


learnings from current project:













For the past 4 years, I've been working as a software developer at Dassault Systemes.

In my role, I’ve had the opportunity to design, develop a ruby on rails gem from scratch.
I'm skilled in working with databases like MySQL and PostgreSQL.


I'm currently working on a ruby on rails technology where I’m developing a database driver and ActiveRecord adapter to connect Ruby applications to our in-house database.
I can explain this further if you'd like

Current Goal:
I’m now looking for a position that allows me to build on my skills in Ruby on Rails, web development, and database management, where I can make meaningful contributions and continue to grow in my career.
